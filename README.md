## Path of the Warrior
#### Text Adventure Story | Project Codecademy 

In this project, the user is given a chance to live the life of either a samurai or an assassin. You begin the story with your name and choosing which path you would like to go down. After path selection, the user is then given a choice of weapon depending on which path he/she chose. The user is then given a chance to proceed to the final battle or change their weapon. After weapon selection has been completed, the user is then given 16 rounds to compete against the opponent. The user and the opponent start the battle with 5 health bars. If either one's health bars are diminished or the total stamina is depleted, the game will be over. This leaves the user with three alternate endings depending on the choices made.
